## Overview

Open Library Explorer allows users to discover books through a catalog that supports pagination, filtering by genre, author, and publication year, and lazy loading. The backend is implemented using Flask with standard routing and Jinja templating, while MongoDB is used for data storage. The frontend leverages Tailwind CSS for styling and vanilla JavaScript for dynamic behavior.

---

## Project Structure

The repository follows a clear and maintainable folder structure:


- **backend/app.py:** Contains all the Flask routes to serve the API and the frontend.
- **backend/templates/index.html:** The main HTML template using Tailwind CSS and JavaScript.
- **backend/requirements.txt:** Lists the required Python packages.

---

## Setup and Run Instructions

### Backend

1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd open-library-explorer/backend
1. **Install Dependencies:Install the required Python packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
1. **Run the Flask Application:Start the Flask server:**

   ```bash
   python app.py

## API Documentation

The Open Library Explorer API provides endpoints to retrieve book data and available genres. Below are the detailed API endpoints, including the required parameters, expected responses, and example payloads.

---

### GET `/books`

**Description:**  
Retrieve a paginated list of books. Supports filtering by genre, author, and publication year.

**Query Parameters:**

- `page` (integer, optional, default: 1)  
  The page number to retrieve.

- `limit` (integer, optional, default: 10)  
  The number of books to return per page.

- `genre` (string, optional)  
  Filter books by genre. Must exactly match the genre string.

- `author` (string, optional)  
  Filter books by author name. Supports partial matches (case-insensitive).

- `published_year` (integer, optional)  
  Filter books by the year they were published.

**Response Example:**

```json
{
  "books": [
    {
      "_id": "603d2149e3b8f12e9c8e4a1d",
      "title": "The Great Adventure",
      "author": "John Doe",
      "genre": "Fiction",
      "summary": "An exhilarating tale of discovery and adventure in a fantastical land...",
      "published_year": 2019,
      "cover_url": "http://example.com/cover.jpg"
    },
    {
      "_id": "603d2149e3b8f12e9c8e4a1e",
      "title": "Mystery of the Lost City",
      "author": "Jane Smith",
      "genre": "Mystery",
      "summary": "A suspenseful journey into a city shrouded in secrets and ancient lore...",
      "published_year": 2015,
      "cover_url": "http://example.com/cover2.jpg"
    }
  ],
  "page": 1,
  "limit": 10,
  "total": 1000
}

```
## System Design Explanation and Decisions

### Data Modeling

- **Schema:**  
  Each book document in the MongoDB collection contains the following fields:
  - `title` (String): The title of the book.
  - `author` (String): The authorâ€™s name.
  - `genre` (String): The genre category of the book.
  - `summary` (String): A brief description or summary of the book.
  - `published_year` (Integer): The year the book was published.
  - `cover_url` (String, Optional): URL to the book's cover image.

- **Rationale:**  
  This schema was chosen for its simplicity and flexibility. MongoDB's document model allows for easy scaling and future modifications, such as adding new fields without breaking existing records.

### API Structure

- **Routing and Templating:**  
  The backend uses Flask routing with standard endpoints, and integrates Jinja templating to serve the frontend. This keeps API logic and view rendering clearly separated while still allowing for dynamic content generation.

- **Endpoints:**  
  - **GET `/books`:** Supports pagination and filtering by genre, author, and publication year. This allows clients to fetch a subset of books, minimizing data transfer and improving UI responsiveness.
  - **GET `/books/<book_id>`:** Retrieves detailed metadata for a specific book using its unique identifier.
  - **GET `/genres`:** Returns a list of all distinct genres, enabling dynamic filter generation on the frontend.

- **Pagination & Filtering:**  
  The API supports pagination via query parameters (`page` and `limit`), enabling efficient data retrieval. Filtering allows users to narrow down search results without fetching the entire dataset, which is crucial when dealing with large collections.

### Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading:**  
  The frontend uses lazy loading (a "Load More" button) to load additional data incrementally. This reduces the initial load time and improves user experience, especially on mobile devices.

- **Indexing:**  
  Although not explicitly implemented in this demo project, in a production scenario, indexes should be added on frequently filtered fields (such as `genre`, `author`, and `published_year`) to optimize query performance.

- **Caching:**  
  For further performance enhancements, server-side caching (e.g., using Redis) could be considered to reduce the load on the database for repeated queries.

### Frontend Design

- **Responsive and Modern UI:**  
  The frontend is built using Tailwind CSS, which provides a modern, responsive design out of the box. This ensures that the application looks good on all screen sizes and devices.

- **User Experience Enhancements:**  
  Features like genre badges, hover effects, and a clearly visible "Load More" button contribute to an intuitive user experience. The design emphasizes clarity and ease of navigation.

### Trade-offs and Future Enhancements

- **Simplicity vs. Scalability:**  
  The project is designed for clarity and ease of understanding, focusing on demonstrating key concepts such as routing, templating, pagination, and filtering. For a production-level application, additional features such as user authentication, robust error handling, logging, and security measures would be necessary.

- **Potential Enhancements:**  
  - Implement custom modals instead of JavaScript alerts for displaying detailed book information.
  - Add debounced search functionality for real-time filtering.
  - Introduce sorting options (e.g., by title, author, or publication year).
  - Deploy the application on a scalable hosting platform.
  - Add unit and integration tests to ensure long-term maintainability and reliability.

### Overall Decision Rationale

The overall design prioritizes:
- **Clarity:** The project uses clear, modular code that separates concerns between the frontend and backend.
- **Performance:** Efficient data retrieval strategies (pagination, lazy loading) are implemented to handle large datasets.
- **Maintainability:** The folder structure and code organization follow best practices, making it easy for developers to understand and extend the project.
- **User Experience:** A responsive, visually appealing frontend ensures that users can interact with the catalog smoothly.

This system design balances the need for a simple demonstration of full-stack principles with practical considerations for scalability and user experience.
